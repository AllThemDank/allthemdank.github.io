            <h3>Reasons not to use Apple</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/topic/iphone">
Apple iThings</a> pioneered a new level of restricting the users:
they were the first general purpose computers to impose censorship
over what programs the user can install.  Apple practices
<a href="http://rotten-apple.org/"> Digital Restrictions Management</a>
in many other ways too.

</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks">Apple forbids recyclers of Apple computers</a> from extracting any
usable spare parts from them, by imposing nasty contracts.
</p><p>
Apple's conduct should be forbidden by law so that no company can
ever do this.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple is
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/source-apple-will-fight-right-to-repair-legislation">campaigning against right-to-repair laws</a> that weaken
the unjust effect of the DMCA.

<li>
<p>
The iPhone 7
<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/iphone-7-home-button-unreplaceable-repair-software-lock">has
DRM specifically to brick it</a> if anyone other than an authorized
repair agent fixes it.</p>
<p>

The term
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#DigitalLocks">"lock"</a>
is inadequate to describe this sort of malware.  Let's use other words
that show what's really going on.</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple
faces trial in Australia for
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/05/apple-error-53-sting-operation-caught-staff-misleading-customers-court-documents-allege">
bricking devices because they had had
an "unauthorized" repair.
</a>
<p>
</li>

<li><p>
The Apple CEO met with <a href="/glossary.html#trump">the troll</a> and said: "Tim Cook from Apple, I'm
here to talk to the President-elect about the things we can do to help
you achieve your stated goal."
<p>
This text was transcribed from a video recording.  I can't offer a
reference because the web site requires nonfree Javascript code.
<p>
Cook was
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/22/apple-ceo-tim-cook-met-with-trump-to-engage-on-gigantic-corporate-tax-cut/">
angling for a big tax cut</a> for multinational businesses.
</li>

<li><p>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/22/young-appmakers-cant-job-life">Apple
exploits the app developers mercilessly,</a> aside from a few stars
whose role is to give a misleading impression of what developers can
expect.</p>
<p>
I can't sympathize much with those app developers, since they are
making proprietary software.  They all deserve to fail.  However, that
doesn't excuse the way Apple treats them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Apple lures people into the business of developing apps with visions of
the great wealth that a few of them get.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=4&hp">
Most just fail, often losing a substantial investment.</a></p>
<p>
Anyone who intentionally develops proprietary software (i.e., does not
respect users' freedom) deserves no sympathy, but that doesn't
excuse Apple for luring people into it.  Some of them would not have
tried to develop proprietary software if not for Apple.</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple is a major patent aggressor.  Here's a
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/apple-now-owns-the-page-turn/?smid=tw-nytimesbits&seid=auto">
rather absurd patent</a> that Apple will surely use against other
mobile computers.  This joins many other patents which Apple is already
using to attack free software.
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="/archives/2011-jan-apr.html#20%20February%202011%20%28More%20groans%29">
Ebooks with DRM</a> won't work on an iThing that is jailbroken, due
to intentional sabotage by Apple.</p>
<p>
E-books with digital handcuffs are products <a href="http://DefectiveByDesign.org/"> designed to attack your
freedom</a>, much like the iThing itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Lots of iThing users complained that they did not want the U2
album "gift" that Apple stuck them with &mdash; and that it was
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-free-u2-album-perplexes-and-annoys-some-users/">hard
to delete</a>.</p>
<p>
These complaints focus on a superficial problem, reflecting the
shallow thinking that Apple instills in its users.  Ironically,
though, this superficial problem reflects a much deeper problem that
the complainers have failed to notice: the unjust power that Apple has
imposed on whoever uses an iThing or iTunes.</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple practices censorship.  Here are a few examples.

  <ul>

  <li>
  <p>Apple used its censorship system to enforce China's censorship
  by
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/apple-removes-new-york-times-app-in-china">blocking
  distribution of the New York Times app</a>.</p>
  <p>
  More about Apple's
  <a href="http://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html">censorship
  of apps and other malicious functionalities</a> in Apple
  software.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Apple appears to be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/10/apple-blocks-bitcoin-payments-on-secure-messaging-app-gliph">censoring
  all bitcoin apps for iThings.</a></p>
  <p>It should be illegal to make or distribute computers which are
  platforms for censorship.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Apple demonstrates the arbitrariness of its censorship
  by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/30/apple-blocks-us-drone-strike-app">blocking
  an app that tells people with text messages when US drone attacks
  kill civilians</a>.</p>

  <p>The author said that this app was meant to raise awareness.
  I hope Apple's censorship of it raises awareness.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Apple censors <a
  href="/archives/2011-nov-feb.html#4_December_2011_%28Apple%29">information
  about abortion providers</a>.</li>

  <li>
  As of 2015, Apple
  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/apple-anti-choice-tendencies-showing-in-app-store-reproductive-rights">
  systematically bans apps</a> that endorse abortion
  rights or would help women find abortions.
  <p>
  This particular political slant
  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/siri-abortion-apple-unintenional-omissions">
  affects other Apple services</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
  Apple's mail service <a
  href="/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#11_July_2011_%28Apple_Mail_Censored%29">silently
  censors the mail</a> people send.</li>

  <li>
  Apple <a
  href="/archives/2010-nov-feb.html#23%20December%202010%20%28Apple%20pulls%20Wikileaks%20app%20from%20store%29">deauthorized
  a Wikileaks access application</a>, using censorship to support
  censorship.</li>

  <li>
  <p>Apple <a href="http://news.techeye.net/internet/apple-begins-censoring-books">censors iTunes ebooks</a> &mdash;
  banning all mention of Amazon.</p>
  <p>
  People should not do business with Amazon, which <a
  href="/amazon.html"> mistreats authors, publishers, its workers,
  and its customers</a>.  Ms Lisle's presupposition that the goal of
  success is all that matters is not admirable.</p>
  <p>
  However, that doesn't justify Apple's censorship.</p>
  <p>
  Of course, publishing in iTunes was already bad for other reasons,
  such as DRM, and requiring users to use nonfree software.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Apple
  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/nov/16/erotic-novel-removed-itunes-cover"> banned
  from iTunes</a> the erotic novel, The Proof of the Honey,
  saying it was because of the cover.
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Apple censored a game for the iThings called <a
  href="http://storify.com/fredericjacobs/the-hypocrisy-of-the-west">Angry
  Syrians</a>, which is a political parody of Angry Birds.</p>

  Apple said it was "defamatory or
  offensive" &mdash; to the dictator Assad, apparently.
  </li>
  </ul>

<p>
Repeated acts of censorship are not the only reason to condemn iTunes.
We should refuse to buy from iTunes because it requires nonfree software,
imposes licenses more restrictive than copyright law, and often imposes DRM.</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple spies on its users, and helps others spy on them.

  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>If you carry a cell phone, it
  <a href="/archives/2010-may-aug.html#24%20June%202010%20%28Apple%20sells%20more%20data%20on%20customers%29">tells Big Brother where you are</a>.  Apple wants to hand out the information too.</p>

  <p>
  Using the lever of "You have a choice, but unless you say yes,
your old activities will stop working" is something that Apple has
done before, with malicious "upgrades". Apple ostensibly doesn't force
people to accept the new nasty thing; it just punishes them if they
don't.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Apple <a href="/archives/2011-nov-feb.html#28_November_2011_%28Apple_iTunes_Government_Spying%29">left
  a security hole in iTunes unfixed for 3 years</a> after being
  informed about the problem. During that time, governments used
  that security hole to invade people's computers.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>

Apple persists in disregarding the <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html?pagewanted=all">widespread
blatant abuse</a> of the workers that build its products.

  <ul>
  <li>
  In 2015, the workers making Apple products in China are
  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/labor/new-report-shows-apple-reforms-have-been-obtained-only-through-activism-and-journalism">still
  mistreated</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Apple uses
  <a href="/archives/2010-sep-dec.html#16%20October%202010%20%28Apples%20Foxconn%20sweatshops%29">
sweatshops in China</a> to build its products.
  </li>

  <li>
  Sweatshops are good for Foxconn (and for Apple), but <a
href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/95395223/Sweatshops-Are-Good-for-Apple-and-Foxconn-But-Not-for-Workers">
not for workers</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
  An undercover journalist reports on the horrible conditions in the
Foxconn factory that makes iThings: <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/13/cost-iphone-5-foxconn-factory">still
horrible in 2012</a>.
  </li>

  <li>

  Foxconn closed schools and <a
href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/09/12/838341/foxconn-student-workers/">
forced the students to work building iThings</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
  Working conditions at Apple's other Chinese suppliers are even <a
  href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/28/us-apple-china-suppliers-idUSBRE85R0EA20120628">worse
  than in Foxconn</a>.
  </li>

  <li>

  Today's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jul/29/apple-investugates-claims-china-factory">Apple
  Pegatron sweatshops are even nastier than the Foxconn sweatshops</a>
  it used before.
  <p>
  Just because you're not pregnant, should that make it ok to require
  you to work 11 hours a day, 6 days a week?  Apple is culpable if its
  products are made by people working a longer workweek than is allowed
  in the US.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Mistreatment of workers making Apple computers
  <a
  href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories">
  continues in 2014</a>.
  <p>
  This is a general injustice, and will continue until the "brand"
  companies are made legally responsible for treatment of the workers
  that do their work, just as if they were direct employees of those
  companies.  But that doesn't excuse Apple.
  </li>

  </ul>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Apple turns a
<a href="/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#4_September_2011_%28Apple:_Environment_in_China%29">
blind eye to environment in China</a>.</p>
<p>
Although Apple has joined EPEAT again, it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/16/apple-rejoins-epeat">does
not cover the iThings</a> &mdash; only the Macintosh.</p>
</li>

<li>
Apple practices <a
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/04/apple-ipad-software-update">planned
obsolescence for the iBad</a> &mdash; in just two years.
</li>

<li>
<p>Apple
pioneered <a href="/archives/2012-mar-jun.html#30_April_2012_%28Apple%29"> techniques
for avoiding the US corporate tax</a> (even though it is far too low) in order
to pay next to no tax.</p>

The loopholes that Apple uses would be closed, if not for the
political power of business. "Free trade" treaties give business
increased power to block such changes, so we must abolish them to
break business's power.</li>

<li>
<p>
Apple store staff are taught
<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5938323/how-to-be-a-genius-this-is-apples-secret-employee-training-manual">twisted
psychological manipulation</a>.</p>
The mere practice of referring to service staff as "geniuses"
is dishonest already.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Apple machines are built with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe">unusual screws</a> that
make it difficult for the owner to take them apart.
<p>
Along with technical barriers,
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apple-right-to-repair_us_5755a6b4e4b0ed593f14fdea">
Apple lobbies against</a> "right to repair" laws.

            <h3>Apple store</h3>

            <p>The goddamn Apple Store is so fucking trendy these motherfuckers don't even use cash registers anymore. Like holy shit why would I ever want to wait in line to pay for my immensely overpriced lightning bolt-to-usb cable, when I can wander around aimlessly looking for the one bearded top knot in the grey shirt who happens to have a card reader attached to his free iPhone 6? Literally fucking walked up a dude and was like 'Yo where's the till?' And guy looks at me straight in the fucking face and says, 'Oh well, there should be one or two people walking around on either side of the store who can process your payment.' ALL OF YOU DRESS EXACTLY THE SAME! Am I supposed to accost every single goddamn one of you until I finally find the one goddamn fucking anthropomorphisized Mac Computer who is willing to let me pay for this shit? And when I finally find the dude and let him tap his shit against the box that I'm trying to purchase, of course he gives me the smuggest fucking smile I've ever seen on a human face and asks, 'Would you like to use Apple Pay?' Like GOOD LORD can we please just take a step outside of your möbius fucking circle jerk and let me hand you fifteen pounds in cash? Cash money? Real fucking physical fucking tender? No it's okay, I don't need a fucking receipt. What, you mean you're going to print me a real receipt? A physical receipt that I can carry in my pocket? You're not gonna beam it to my fucking wrist? You're not going to send it via dropbox to an undisclosed fucking IP Address where I have to complete a CAPTCHA and accept your terms and conditions for the one millionth time in order to check that, yes, I did just spend £20 pounds and 45 minutes on a thin wire made of plastic and metal that's gonna break in a month anyway? I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND THIS PLANET ANYMORE </p>
