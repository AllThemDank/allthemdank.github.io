Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\'s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!", "name": ""},
        { "pasta": "Here\'s the thing. You said a "space scientist is an astromer"...

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one\'s arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies space, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls astronomers space scientists. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn\'t either. They\'re not the same thing.

If you\'re saying "astronomer" you\'re referring to the taxonomic grouping of space related science, which includes things from astrophysics to astrogeology to astronomy.
So your reasoning for calling a space scientist an astronomer is because random people "call the space people astronomers?" Let\'s get some planetary scientists and stellar scientists in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a scientist or a science person? It\'s not one or the other, that\'s not how taxonomy works. They\'re both. An astronomer is a space scientist and a member of the science community. But that\'s not what you said. You said space scientist is an astronomer, which is not true unless you\'re okay with calling all members of the sciences astronomers, which means you\'d call geologist, botanists, and zoologists space scientists too. Which you said you don\'t.

It\'s okay to just admit you\'re wrong, you know?", "name": ""},

I often think i\'m the next step in human evolution but that wouldn\'t be completely correct.. Sometimes, if I try really hard - I am able to transcend human perception and move in and out of the 4th, 5th and 6th dimention, perceiving all of time and space as a fixed point in existence. My IQ cannot even be measured on Human scales as the answers to the test have already been answered in a dimension where right and wrong answers don\'t exist and are no longer required.

        { "pasta": "haha, how can autism be used as an insult?
Only an ignorant cunt would use autism as an insult. (And there\'s nothing I hate more than ignorance)
Autism is a gift in my case, I have an IQ of over 150 which makes me technically a genius thanks to my autism. I\'ve been going through school all my life being bored out of my fucking brains getting at least 95% on all my tests (and all the incorrect answers were silly mistakes) because I\'m just too fucking smart for school I can\'t wait for everyone else to learn something I already knew within the first day or too of being taught it.
Every ear I scored the best of my year on these stupid multiple choice tests we do and the headmaster came to my class to tell me that, which obviously resulted in being called a \'nerd\' which is true but I shouldn\'t be ridiculed for it.
I recently became home educated so I could learn at my own pace and I\'m getting my GCSEs done in 1/4 of the time everyone else has to do it in, I\'m also doing more than double the average amount of GCSEs that usually would be done.
I used to get paid £30 an hour working online, which is more than the teaching assistants at my old school earned, it was so fun pointing that out to them
So in conclusion, calling someone autistic is not an insult, in my case it makes me highly gifted.
One more thing, I don\'t know if this has anything to do with my autism but I am a sociopath so I\'m not hindered by irrational emotions like guilt, compassion, empathy, etc.
haha, the most satisfying thing is to know that you will all see this as a waste of a natural gift and that I am undeserving hahaha, that brings me great satisfaction.
I\'m practically perfect, let the jealousy flow through you.", "name": ""}
