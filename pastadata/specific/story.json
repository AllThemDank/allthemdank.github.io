After you’re ✔good✔ an 😍🌵horny😉, you get some 🍞bread. My 🐦pigeons🐓 preferred 🍞🍞white bread but 🍆👍💪healthier 🐥🐤birds🐣 might have a 👅taste👅💦 for 🍼🍭honey wheat🌿🌾 or maybe even 🔢multigrain🔢. ✊Fat, unhealthy😷 birds🐓🐦 are ❌slower and ✅easier to 💦hit💦 so remember✅✔ that. Once you are 👍seated👇 on the 🌳bench and ⚠ready⚠ to 😉😉do the deed😍😛, whip👊 your 🍆roosevelt🍆 out and scatter 🍞bread🍞 out within a few 👇feet of you. use your 😕judgement based✊👌 on how far↔ you know you can 💦cum💦. I was a lonely😢😥 and depraved😲😵 soul💫✨ who could 🔒hit targets💦🎯 the size of a 👌thimble at distances up to ⃣feet. You wait for the 🐦pigeons🐥 to begin ✊👌eating and to get ☺comfortable with 🙋your presence. At this point⏬, you want to 😉😯coo gently👅 and talk 👄sensually💋 to them to 🔒gain their ✅trust. Now you’re finally ready to 💦cum💦 on your 🐦bird. This is a 💪tough part because the 🏃rapid motion💨 of 💦masturbation🍆 is very frightening😲😮 to the birds🐤🐦, so you have to be 🙅🙈subtle. Once you 👵master💯 a 🆗technique, you simply wind🔃 it up⬆ and let it ♻go🔛, ❌🎯aiming depending on your past 💦cumming💦 experiences🍆.

        { "pasta": "Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.
