He was wearing earbuds in a gym that already plays music. He doesn\'t even change and his "gymwear" is already on. He walks straight to the squat rack and starts squatting with the bar (what?). Then he loads a few small plates on and does 5 struggling reps. At this point he sits down and his face is as red as a tomato. He sits on his ass for 2 minutes then does 5 more. At this point I think he is done, but then this idiot takes all the weight off his bar and starts Overhead pressing. What? Mr. Earbud does the same 5 forced reps like an idiot, panting from less reps than I do as warmup, he empties the bar again. Then he starts doing deadlifts with the SAME FUCKING BAR. At this point the entire gym is staring and we are laughing our asses off. Hoodieboy does 5 painfully struggling reps and then just gives up. He empties the bar once again and walks out of the gym. His whole entire workout lasted 30 minutes. My friend and I are practically in tears. Then this fucktard shows up 2 days later wearing the same clothes.", "name": ""},
